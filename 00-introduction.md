# Introduction

> Always have the fear of God before your eyes. Remember him who gives death and life. Hate the world and all that is in it. Hate all peace that comes from the flesh. Renounce this life, so that you may be alive to God. Remember what you have promised God, for it will be required of you on the day of judgement. Suffer hunger, thirst, nakedness, be watchful and sorrowful; weep, and groan in your heart; test yourselves, to see if you are worthy of God; despise the flesh, so that you may preserve your souls.
> — Anthony the Great, _Sayings of the Desert Fathers_

Of the Yozis, the most familiar and yet most forgotten is the Endless Desert which forms the boundary of the demon realm. Since the Yozis were first described, hell's lawmaker has seemed redundant with the Principle of Hierarchy, and that only grew worse with added description of similarly worshipful or desolate Yozis. Though Cecelyne's charmset provided clues, it so frequently fell into the trap of easy references to Ancient Egypt or the Islamic Golden Age. While retreading these familiar sands is to be expected, the Endless Desert is at her heart Byzantine, a Church inseparable from her brother the Emperor.

## How to Use This Book

**Books of the Damned: Canticle of the Desert** is a setting book for any edition of the **Exalted** game, but it is especially based in the more rationalist tropes of Second edition. This book contains only the Endless Desert – but the Endless Desert in her entirety. A Yozi is at once a place, a pantheon, and a collection of peoples. Like the treacherous Great Maker is the entire setting of Autochthonia, this book explores a game set in and populated by Cecelyne alone.
**Chapter One: A Legal History**
**Chapter Two: The Priestess Divine**
**Chapter Three: Forty Laments**
