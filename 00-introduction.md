# Introduction

> Always have the fear of God before your eyes. Remember him who gives death and life. Hate the world and all that is in it. Hate all peace that comes from the flesh. Renounce this life, so that you may be alive to God. Remember what you have promised God, for it will be required of you on the day of judgement. Suffer hunger, thirst, nakedness, be watchful and sorrowful; weep, and groan in your heart; test yourselves, to see if you are worthy of God; despise the flesh, so that you may preserve your souls.  
    — St. Anthony the Great, _Sayings of the Desert Fathers_

Of the Yozis, the most familiar and yet most neglected is the Endless Desert who forms the boundary of the demon realm. Since the Yozis were first described, hell's lawmaker has seemed redundant with the Principle of Hierarchy, and that has only grown worse with new information on similarly worshipful or desolate Yozis. Though Cecelyne's Second Edition charmset tried to find a place for her, it so frequently fell into the trap of easy references to Ancient Egypt or the Islamic Golden Age. While retreading these familiar sands is to be expected, the Endless Desert is at her heart Byzantine, a Church inseparable from her brother the Emperor.

## How to Use This Book

**Songs of the Damned: Canticle of the Desert** is a setting book for any edition of the **Exalted** game, but it is especially based in the rationalist tropes of Second Edition. This book contains only the Endless Desert – but the Endless Desert reaching to eternity. A Yozi is at once a place, a pantheon, and a collection of peoples. Like the treacherous Great Maker is the entire setting of Autochthonia, this book explores a game set in and populated by Cecelyne alone.  
**Chapter One: A Legal History**  
As elder sister of the Primordial King, Cecelyne has held special power over her peers since the earliest days. Even in their damnation, she is in some ways his co-equal, for her laws bind even his own souls. This section follows the Lawmaker Princess as her concept of justice degrades with each era.  
**Chapter Two: The Priestess Divine**  
The Primordials are divinity of divinity, makers of gods and domains. What need have they for religion? This section details the Yozi herself in all her forms. Here, you will find her relationships with her fellow inmates, notable locations nestled amongst her sands, and her plans for Creation.  
**Chapter Three: Forty Laments**  
A being of sublime suffering, Cecelyne's souls are called laments. Each represents a virtue and a deprivation. This section introduces a number of demons who are known to Creation's sorcerers or are familiar faces to frequent travelers of the Endless Desert.  
**Chapter Four: True Lawgivers**  
Mortals are inferiors, no matter how Exalted. Listed here are the virtuous among their number – those who know their place as Cecelyne's hands beyond her outer boundary. This section also catalogues her opinion of mortals more generally, living and dead, and her thoughts on events of violent upheaval and lawlessness.  
**Chapter Five: Storytelling**  
This section briefly covers many of the issues with a game focused on the Endless Desert, from "why aren't we using fast travel?" to the tone demons and Infernals should have at your table. Cecelyne represents a very different and less human-centric setting than Creation, Autochthonia, or even the Underworld. Whether visiting or spending an entire campaign in her embrace, she requires a different playstyle.
