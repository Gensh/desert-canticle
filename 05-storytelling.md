# Chapter Five: Storytelling

- Don't do Infernals like last time.
    - Rather than failure, they feel cheated.
    - Session Zero, etc.
- The Endless Desert vs just playing in the South like a normal group.
- Monastic game with no real action – a vehicle for character exploration.
- Social game about herding cats.
- Crossing the Desert into other Shards.
- Caravan – some players need and enjoy a railroad.
