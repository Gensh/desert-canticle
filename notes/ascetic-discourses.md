- "If you hear about a weakness of your brother, do not tell it to anyone, for this will lead to your (spiritual) death."
- "If a brother obliges you to slander someone, do not pretend to be modest or convinced by him, otherwise you sin against God. Instead, say to him in humility, 'Forgive me, brother, but I am wretched and all that you say, in fact, describes me, and so I cannot bear to hear it'".
- "If you have left your natural relatives in order to be in isolation for the sake of God, do not allow the pleasure of their rememberance to come to you while you are sitting in your cell, feeling pity for your father or mother, or remembering your brother or sister, or perhaps feeling compassion for your child or wife in your heart, for you have left all these behind. Instead, remember your departure in relation to the urgency of your death when none of these people will help you. Why should you not leave them behind for the sake of virtue?"
- "If you lead an ascetic life, do not let your heart take confidence that it is protecting you, but think to yourself, 'It is because of the mortification of my body that God hears my misery'".

- "If you are leading a life of ascetic discpline for the sake of God and people become envious of you, or honor you in regard to this, then leave this discipline and embark upon another, so that your toil may not be in vain".
- "Before all else, the first struggle is exile; especially if you have fled alone, then the struggle is to leave your own and move to another place, bearing perfect faith and hope, as well as a stable heart with regard to your own desires, for thoughts will completely encircle you, frightening you about templatations, hardships in poverty, and illnesses, suggesting to you questions about how you will cope with these if you have no one who cares for, or knows you. [...] Those who endure the tribulation of exile are brougth to the virtue of hope, and this hope protects them, at least partially, from fleshly desire, for you are not in exile for its own sake, but in order to prepare yourself, and have time to struggle against the enemy, so that you may learn how to reject eeach foe in its time, until you reach the rest of dispassion and are liberated as a result of being victorious at each battle, in its own time."
