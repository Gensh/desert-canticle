# Chapter Three: Forty Laments

Some call Cecelyne unrecognizable from the unbroken Primordial she was, perhaps the most changed of the Yozis. This is not true. More accurately, she is like the sand carved from a great stone – all the components are still there but unrecognizable as the original substance and incapable of fulfilling the same purpose.

The Endless Desert borders everything and eternity. More than remembering the Time of Glory, she is still there. Her sands trickle past even her former self, unaware that one so great could be reduced to a form so lowly. Cecelyne echoes the songs of those times with a bitterness they did not originally possess. The Infernal castes are named for the songs the Makers once sang. If the others remembered those songs half as well, they would not speak of them without sorrow.

Each soul of the fractured Lawmaker Princess is a Lament – not just in name but in spirit. They recall the just purposes they once held or bewail the inconstant desires which guide them now.
