# Chapter Three: Forty Laments

> Woe to the writer of these lamentations! I am prey to everything I write and have not the slightest sigh of regret!
> — Abba Isaiah of Scetis, _Ascetic Discourses_

Some call Cecelyne unrecognizable from the unbroken Primordial she was, perhaps the most changed of the Yozis. This is not true. More accurately, she is the sand worn from a great stone – all the components are still there but unrecognizable as the original substance and incapable of fulfilling the same purpose.

The Endless Desert borders everything and eternity. More than remembering the Time of Glory, she is still there. Her sands trickle past even her former self, unaware that one so great could be reduced to a form so lowly. Cecelyne echoes the songs of those times with a bitterness they did not originally possess. The Infernal castes are named for the songs the Makers once sang. If the others remembered those songs half as well, they would not speak of them without sorrow.

Each soul of the fractured Lawmaker Princess is a Lament – not just in name but in spirit. They recall the just purposes they once held or bewail the inconstant desires which guide them now. Cecelyne is infinite and incomparable; the pinnacle of the Law has no need to hide her weaknesses. Her souls sing of her failings to the ends of her sands, but none grow closer to escaping her.

## Visions of the Law

Until recently, Cecelyne has resented takinig lesser shapes. Her plans were communicated to her lessers by sacred signs and to the Yozis by changes in her desert so large and subtle that only other worlds could distinguish them. More properly communicating with the common run of demon princes was a task she left to her souls. Because of this and because most laments enjoy icons of themselves, most of the Endless Desert's souls have at least one humaniform shape.

Though their mother prefers to wrap herself in the irony of devotion, such explicit religious imagery is not widespread. All are figures of reverence, but the form differs from royalty to masters of sublime skill. What does not differ is the shape their mother has given them. They are things of the Desert, and her mark cannot be hidden.

They are often long and lean and imposing, though some are softer if they are the sort whose endurance relies on gorging. Many take the aspect of mundane creatures of a typical desert – lizards and snakes and scorpions – things which creep under the weight of natural armor and weapons. Yet the Desert is an ideal of Desolation, and they can just as easily be arctic apex predators or urban vermin.

They wear enough camouflage as is appropriate, but they are loath to hide their minimalist glory when it could be hidden in plain sight. It is unbecoming to withhold enlightenment from the weak when they could learn so much from gazing upon the strong.

**Sixteenth Lament of Cecelyne, Demon of the Third Circle**

> Woe to us, for sleep and lethargy allow the demon to deprive our hearts of compunction!

- The lingering desires of Zaemon
- This is the complete set of souls. Having all seven means it's the set most likely to be modified or thrown out. This is alreadythe most campaign-specific set and so likely to be modified anyway.

- High magitech with ascetic Immaculate sensibilities
