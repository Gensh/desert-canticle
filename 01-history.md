# Chapter One: A Legal History

## First Grains in the Hourglass

Cecelyne is the Yozi of religion; not faith. That sort of blind trust is Autochthon's domain and one of the Great Maker's innumerable weaknesses. Yet what need do the vast Primordials, makers of all, have for religion? Religion is not simply belief in a higher power but a system of ritual and tradition – and so of vital importance to creatures who are legend embodied.

When the tribe of dreamers first emerged from Time Not and gathered in the foothills of the Mountain Which Is Throne, they were all but unbound. The other Mountain Apart stood alone, for even a kindred mount could not make his height greater. The dreamers feared for his safety, but the powers of the Unshaped could take nothing from him, for he was Violation.

The other dreamers had thought to climb to safety, but Qaf was Violation and refuted the concept of being unsafe or any height less than infinite. Even damned, the Exalted could not take his infinity from him, for he was Violation. So he was bound in that form, a great black nacre spear driven into the side of Hell Himself.

But this is not a story of Qaf or of his hermits and mysticism and koans. These were all things he learned from the Mother of Rites in exchange for the concept of Perfection, which is a form of Violation quite beautiful because they do not closely resemble their father.

This too was a later story, for Cecelyne did not awaken among her lessers, to the light of the Divine Ignition.

### The Furthest Shore

Only in the most forbidden books of Cecelyne is it recorded how the Empyreal family awoke, and these may be sabotaged by her madness or the schemes of the Exalted. One day, Word became aware of a light which was a signal. Beyond the Burning Sea was the Shore of Eternity, and on that shore gleamed THE INFINITE. HE signaled that HE would come to rule the tribe of dreamers.

Word communicated this Perfectly to his siblings, who were now all quite comfortable with Perfection. They were even now held by the Throne, but the Throne was only a Mountain and the Beast Upon It – and they all felt clever enough to outsmart a Beast. If THE INFINITE were to come, then HE would overwhelm them, and they would have no hope but to pray their desires aligned with HIS own.

We all know what happened next. The Shadow, who was only the shadow of the _idea_ of shadow at the time, acted to ensure he would one day exist. The Burning Sea, who burned and held back THE INFINITE with her own share of Perfection, ceased to do so. It burned her all the more greatly, but she bore THE INFINITE and Eternity over her waters to join the tribe of dreamers.

THE INFINITE showed that HE held within HIMSELF the concept of Kingship, which was more than merely being a Throne. And so after an ageless war, the Mountain's crown was shattered, and the Beast's horns were broken Upon It. Those who senselessly resisted THE INFINITE were quieted first but then became among the loudest of the faithful.

Religion is not simply belief in a higher power, but there was indeed a higher power among the tribe of dreamers.

### Scripture of the First Church

Eternity was the elder sister of INFINITY. This was necessary so that she might witness HIS birth and so know everything about HIM which a creature outside of THE INFINITE could. She was not HIS mother, for what could contain INFINITY? Yet she alone was vast enough for HIM to stand aside and atop without lasting harm.

When HIS holy flame touched her sands, beads of glass formed. The flame allowed itself to be encased, for the shining glass created for the flame a new form of beauty. These beads would later be called the Whispering Flame, who was HIS daughter or lover or lesser SELF. She hated being called all these things and would turn violent if it was suggested that THE INFINITE could become lesser.

These three walked always upon the pure sands of Eternity, which sometimes became cathedrals of sandstone and alabaster. It was on the steps of one such basilica-palace that HE declared HIS Kingship, which would stand upon the Church for its own benefit and emanate from all the beauteous windows of the Church but was not of the Church.

It was only at this point that the Empyreal family learned the secret of Perfection. They had not needed it to overcome the Unshaped or the other dreamers, for they were already things without limit. Now, they would require it to bind the dreamers to them. Before this point, THE INFINITE was all things without pattern or limitation, Eternity was endless shifting sand, and the Whispering Flame was a constellar dance.

Taking assumptions which were only Perfect lessened them in the manner of the fae, but in doing so, each became so much more Real and so capable of deeper influence. This influence spread from the Church as ritual and history written in yantra rather than Mountainous echo. Though still mutable by Will, these histories were immediately clearer and more reproducible. One could easily copy a beautiful history, for it might dwell for an hour or a day instead of only the moment of speaking.

It was in this manner that Eternity began to shackle Time, which had mostly been given free rein among the peaks and valleys of the Throne.

## Oneness with Nothing

The cradle of the titans was the titans and was of the titans. It was made of their bodies and that which they did not hesitate to cast off, for they were in those days without limit. An infinite space had been carved by the Divine Ignition and was filled as they grew. They were each a legend, and so each act of grandeur grew both their selves and their kingdom. This was the place called Zen-mu.

Such was the name given to it in the books of Cecelyne, who was Eternity. The first to be named was the First, Cytherea, who is now more often called the Divine Ignition because mortal scholars mistake parts and wholes. The dreamers who were legends held many such labels, but now by the instruction of Cecelyne, many chose names for themselves to be known with permanence.

Eternity was an art the Mother of Rites shared freely, so to call her only Eternity would mistake her for that invention, which was lesser than herself. All the dreamers now possessed Eternity, and a distant Adrián might be called the Furthest Shore. There would only be one Cecelyne. A true and righteous name meant nothing, so that it might be a unique legend.

### The Scapegoat

With the dreamer called Word, whose name is understandably too overwritten to record here, Cecelyne developed the first system of writing – a subset of all sacred geometry which could describe things by proxy. If enough of these imprecise glyphs were gathered together, they might approximate a greater thing without requiring the power to name that thing in truth.

Even THE INFINITE subjected HIMSELF to a name which was finite so that HE might be better known. Yet the problem of the Broken Beast remained, for the name of that creature was already infinite. The Mountain was fractured and hollow; the Beast Upon It cast out and consigned to desolation; but the name still echoed in rocky crag and quivering bone.

MARDUKTH, MARDUKTH WHO HOLDS IN THRALL!

This was unacceptable, of course. Even a broken echo was too much of a refrain. Now was begun the song of the HOLY TYRANT, and squelching this echo was the opening solo given to HIS elder sister. The Mountain was Throne no longer and was not beyond desecration. The Endless Desert – pure, holy, and sterile – filled the valleys with sand and drowned the thin grasses of worship on which the Beast fed.

The Scapegoat was cast out to the edge of Zen-mu, to bleed dust as the sand wore him down forever. There he remained, for the border of Zen-mu became defined as where he was. He would howl the least part of his name, and the borders of the lands would grow to encompass him, but he found himself no nearer the other dreamers. There he would remain in exile, until the day the hero Garius cut through peak and head alike.

### The Codes of Cecelyne

Cecelyne was the keeper of records, for if she could record the glory of THE INFINITE, what could she not keep? She was the keeper of formal histories, logical, consistent, and agreed-upon… even if some dreamers remembered the events differently. She was fair and unbiased in resolving such disputes, for the overriding existence of THE INFINITE meant there was a truly correct answer to all matters.

Under HIS guidance, the tribe of dreamers continued at Szoreny's game of kings and worlds. Cecelyne walked among the players and observed a great many games, recording the rules by which they were played and stretching herself to fill the gaps.

Before, conflicts between players grew to great conflicts which were at once wars of worlds and fisticuffs among dreamers. Now, all were bound by the codes of Cecelyne. These codes bound the dreamers to the name of their tribe and spilled over to bind the kings and worlds below. Cecelyne was now a new thing – Law, the Lawmaker Princess of the Primordials.

### The Answer Shines Azure

It came to pass that the game grew old. Cecelyne invented new codes to play the old game anew, for the players to restrain themselves by their own wills and find new challenge in limitation. This worked for a time, but she had already gifted them with Eternity. Soon, the new codes were revulsive, for the dreamers were by nature without limit.

They tasted the new thing, Despair, and thought it may be greater than HE who was greater than He Who Held in Thrall. The HOLY TYRANT denied it held HIM, and this weakened it for a time, but even HE had been caught unawares. As was oft the case when a matter required much planning, HE turned to HIS elder sister, who knew the shape of HIS limitless boundary and of all lesser boundaries. Surely, she knew where the end of Despair could be found.

Of course she did. Of course _she_ did. Yes, definitely. A Primordial could not act beyond their essential nature, by the interactions of the shinma or by the Codes of Cecelyne. She who wrote the Codes knew this most of all. Yes.

She turned to her books, which held all knowledge, forward and backward. She would interpret them without falsehood, for that was her duty and her nature. Of course.

But was it, _really_? Her nature was to always be correct, wasn't it? So anything was fine, right? It's not like she had explicitly said she needed to follow the Codes. After all, that would make changing them rather difficult. _Surely_ the Laws held exception for the Lawmaker. That was only reasonable and fair – and she _was_ Fair. All the time. It was her nature, so she _had_ to be. That meant this was fair and right and correct and all those other good things.

As she had before, she invented something. Based it loosely on a report from Adrián, who traveled beyond the reach of her peers. No one else could know, and Adrián lacked the nature to see the lie. Yet _was_ it a lie? There was a new game. _That_ was the end of Despair.

Such was the wisdom of the Endless Desert, who touches everything and eternity.
